# Four In A Row
## A browser game for two players to play on the same computer

A code-along project with TeamTreehouse using HTML, CSS, and Javascript to recreate the classic game Four In A Row on your web browser.

LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys to move between rows

Each player takes turns until one places FOUR tokens IN A ROW horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

May the best player win!
